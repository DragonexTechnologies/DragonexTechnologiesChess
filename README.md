# DragonexTechnologiesChess

Hey everyone,

I made this chess game for local playing, with the latest StockFish chess engine (17.1). I did some research, but with the help of Google Gemini AI I managed to make it in only one day :D.

Everything is locally in game, nothing is sent online to any server or anything. It's 100% private.

Install guide:

1 - Install an appropriate version of Python3 (Tested on Python3.11.10). https://python.org/downloads A restart may be necessary of your computer after.
2 - Come into this folder in terminal/windows powershell and run "pip install -r requirements.txt". This will install the necessary frameworks for the chess to work.
3 - Come into this folder any time now in terminal/windows powershell and to start the game simply type "Chess<OSVERSION>.py" where <OSVERSION> is Linux, Mac, or Windows.

How to play:

After installation, using terminal or windows powershell (depends on the type of your PC), simply type "python Chess<OSVERSION>.py" in this directory, it will open up the game.

The terminal/powershell window will contain a full move list for those that are enthusiasts, you can see that as you play.

I wish you the best of luck!
